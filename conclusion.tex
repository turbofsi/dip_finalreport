\section{Conclustion}
Hopfield network is an easily implemented neural network that can effectively demonstrate associative memory. Partial or corrupted memories can be restored to their correct state. In addition, inputs that are sufficiently close to a stored memory will converge to the desired memory. The choice of weights is key in ensuring the highest rates of accuracy. Hebbian learning optimized via gradient descent seems to be the best choice to optimize the weights while preventing over fitting of the neural network.\newpage
